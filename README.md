A little fun with #10print, here visualizing prime numbers with '\' composite numbers with '/'. Using #P5js. Using HTML textArea like a retro terminal. The script uses frameCount to iterate over the natural numbers (positive integers starting with one). then tests with a textbook prime checking function which returns true or false.

The prime checking function is not practical but I am amazed at how fast the browser is at checking even 4 digit numbers. I am not even using the most basic optimization for finding primes.  I am just checking to the number not to the square root of the number!!!! The idea came out of preparing some basic coding algorithms for middle school kids. I think it's a fun way to approach the prime number algorithm in a novel way.
